My experiments with water consumption

This blog post captures my 3 month long experiment to increase my daily water consumption. I am not going to harp on the benefits of drinking sufficient water everyday, that's a known fact. Inspite of being aware of this fact my daily water intake was horribly low. A quick google search revealed that for a person of my height and weight I should be taking at least 2.7 litres of water everyday.

I read in Tim Ferris' book "The four hour body", that if you can't measure something, you can't control it. So the first step towards controlling my water consumption was to measure the water accurately. 4 glasses, 1 bottle, 5 times a day are all inaccurate ways of measuring and won't help. So the first step was to figure out a way to measure t

Version 1
I started with a small cup (200ml) and kept it next to my water bottle. Instead of sipping water directly from the bottle, I would pour the water in the cup and then drink it. I would log the amount in my mobile (in simple notes application). It was obvious that this process was cumbersome (the extra steps of pouring in cup and logging it in the notes in mobile) and lead to even lesser water consumption. I had to improve on this version. Although, I got a fair idea in a few days that my daily intake was less than 1 litre which was way bel 

Version 2
First step was to remove the extra step (pouring in a cup). So I measured the size of my gulp/sip (15-35ml) and would just count the number of gulps I was taking during each time. This made the processes simpler but introduced quite a bit of inaccuracy because of the variable sip size. Over a period of 10-12 intakes during the day, I could potentially introduce an error of upto 350-400 ml. 

Version 3
I found an app (iDrinkWater) which simplified the logging process quite a bit (not completely though). Then I removed the extra step of pouring in the cup by marking my drinking bottle with measurements on it (using a permanent markers)


Few minor hacks worth mentioning

1. The bottles that I use has a flip top which can be opened with flick of your thump. Another step to make the process easy, quick and simple. It's a hurdle if you have to remove and close the bottle cap by screwing and unscrewing the top.

2. I initially thought of buying a sports bottle which comes with measurement marks, but they were too expensive and the marks were not sufficientlly small (at 20 ml)
