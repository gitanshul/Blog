My experiments with water consumption

This blog post captures the 3 month long experiment that I did to increase my
daily water consumption. I am not going to harp on the benefits of drinking
sufficient water everyday, that's a know fact. I had known it for a very long
time. I was also aware that I my daily water intake was horribly low and it
needed to be increased before I get sick.

I read in Tim Ferris' book "The four hour body", that if you can't measure
something, you can't control it. So the first step towards controlling my water
consumption was to measure it as accurately as possible. 4 glasses, 1 bottle, 5
times a day are all inaccurate ways of measuring and won't help.
